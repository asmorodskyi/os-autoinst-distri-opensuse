# Summary: HPC_Module: standard installation
#    This test is as simple as it can be at the moment, since we are at the very
#    beginning of HPC testing
#    It only adds the repo and installs the four important packages to check if there are any
#    dependency issues
# Maintainer: Anton Smorodskyi <asmorodskyi@suse.com>, soulofdestiny <mgriessmeier@suse.com>
